00:00.739 --> 00:05.739
(metal creaking)
(rubble crumbling)

00:07.065 --> 00:09.732
(alarm blaring)

00:10.682 --> 00:12.690
(dramatic music)

00:12.690 --> 00:14.610
- Legend has it

00:14.610 --> 00:17.670
that somewhere on the other side of space

00:17.670 --> 00:20.670
is a diamond the size of a planet

00:22.390 --> 00:25.083
and everyone is out to find it.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.710
So I guess it all comes down to one thing.

00:30.710 --> 00:33.760
(machines warbling)
(jet blasting)

00:33.760 --> 00:35.237
Who will find it first?

00:35.237 --> 00:38.070
(dramatic music)
